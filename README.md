For this project, I built a simple calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file structures the calculator, displaying the buttons and screen. 
The calculator includes standard functionality like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and clearing the display. The CSS file styles the 
calculator, giving it a modern look with a dark theme and bright, interactive buttons. The JavaScript file handles the logic behind the calculator, allowing 
users to perform basic arithmetic operations and dynamically update the display. This project showcases my ability to integrate different web technologies to
create an interactive application.
